'''
# if, elif, and else are all keywords in Python used for conditional branching.
# condition1 and condition2 are expressions that evaluate to either True or False.
# If condition1 is True, the code block nested under the if statement will be executed, and the elif and else blocks will be skipped.
# If condition1 is False and condition2 is True, the code block nested under the elif statement will be executed, and the else block will be skipped.
# If both condition1 and condition2 are False, the code block nested under the else statement will be executed.
'''
Syntax:
if condition1:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # Code block to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are False

Program:


x = 10

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x < 10:
    print("x is less than 10")
else:
    print("x is equal to 10")
