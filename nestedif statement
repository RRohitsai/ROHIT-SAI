'''
# The outer if statement checks a condition.
# If the outer condition is True, the code block nested under the outer if statement is executed.
# Inside this code block, there's another if statement (the inner if statement) that can have its own condition.
# If the inner condition is also True, the code block nested under the inner if statement is executed.

Syntax:

if outer_condition:

    else:
        print("y is not greater than 2")
