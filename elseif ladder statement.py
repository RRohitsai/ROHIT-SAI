> Each elif statement provides an alternative condition to check if the preceding if statement's condition is False.
> If a condition in an elif statement is True, the corresponding code block is executed, 
    and subsequent elif and else blocks are skipped.
> If none of the conditions are True, the else block (if present) is executed.

Syntax:
if condition1:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 and condition2 are False, and condition3 is True
...
else:
    # Code block to execute if none of the conditions are True
Program:

x = 10

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x < 10:
